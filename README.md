# COMP 345 - Risk

The specific project for this semester consists in building a simple *Risk* computer game. üïπÔ∏è

The developed program will have to be compatible with the rules and map files and the command-line play of the [*Domination*](https://sourceforge.net/projects/domination/) version of *Risk*. A *Risk* game  consists  of  a connected  map graph representing  a  world  map,  where  each  node  is  a  country  and  each  edge  represents adjacency between countries. Two or more players can play by placing armies on countries they own, from which they can attack adjacent countries to conquer them. The objective of the game is to conquer all countries on the map.
